# issue-blog

This is a POC for generating a Hugo blog from Github Issues.

It was inspired by a post on Mastodon:

> I was thinking that GitHub Issues is actually a relatively good blogging platform.  
> Has comments, likes, text formatting, image embedding, code formatting.  
> They're just called issues, which I don't have an issue with.  
> The dealbreaker was no RSS feed, until I saw that they do appear in your general user RSS on GitHub github.com/olafurw.atom  
> People would just need to filter by repo name and <id>IssuesEvent</id>
